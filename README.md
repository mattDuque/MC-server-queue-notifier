# 2b2t Queue server notifier
A small piece of sofware to keep you  aware of your position in queue while you wait

## What it does
It creates a persistant toast notification on Win10 informing you of your current position in queue,
as you get closer to entering the server the notifications get more frequent and when you finally connect,
it sends a final notification and closes itself.

It only works on Win10, whithout any help I have no plans of porting it to another OS, but if you have any suggestions I'm all ears
